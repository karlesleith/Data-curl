<h3><i>Hi!  Thanks for coming!</i></h3>

<p>These tutorials explain their subjects clearly, simply, and
briefly, and yet completely enough to be useful. They cover both the
underlying concepts and the practical details, to give a solid
understanding that you can apply to immediate needs. Although they're
concise and use simple words, they convey as much information as
longer documents would. (These days, none of us has time to waste--
all else being equal, I'd rather learn something in two pages than in
twenty.)

<p><i><b>HTML</b> lets you make Web pages without a special tool;
<b>CGI</b> lets you make pages that respond to user input;
<b>HTTP</b> lets you write Web servers, clients, or other network 
  programs (it's not used in making Web pages).</i>
